    "Tree-based methods can be used for obtaining option prices, which are especially popular for pricing American options. Binomial (BAPM/BOPM), trinomial (TAPM/TOPM), and random tree methods (RTM) can be used to price many options, including plain vanilla options, and also exotic options such as barrier options, digital options, Asian options, and others.\n",

    "The binomial options pricing model (BOPM) approach has been widely used since it is able to handle a variety of conditions for which other models cannot easily be applied. This mainly since the BOPM is based on the description of an underlying instrument over a period of time rather than a single point. Therefore, it can be used to price Americans that are exercisable $\\forall \\, t \\in [0, T]$."

    "**Broadie** and **Glasserman** ('97) proposed the simulated random tree to price Americans, deriving the upper/lower bounds; this combo makes it easier to measure & control error as computational effort increases $(m \\to \\infty)$. The main drawback of RTM is *computational requirements* grow exponentially with $m$, # of exercise dates, applicable only when $m < \\text{big number}$. For $m = \\text{small number}$, RTM works well & shows theme of **mananging scores** of **high/low bias**."
