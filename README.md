## FE545 - Design, Patterns, & Derivatives Pricing

This repository contains all the materials, including code, assignments, and notes, for the course FE545 - Design, Patterns, & Derivatives Pricing.

### Course Description

This course delves into the design patterns and implementation of financial models using object-oriented programming in C++. It emphasizes advanced applications in quantitative finance, particularly the pricing of derivatives and their calculations using well-known formulas like Black-Scholes and lattice models. The course explores simulation techniques widely used in financial engineering problems, such as Monte Carlo simulation, and their implementation.

### Student Learning Outcomes

After successfully completing this course, students will be able to:
1. Understand common object-oriented (OO) design patterns and their application in financial modeling.
2. Implement common OO design patterns in financial models, focusing on clarity, simplicity, elegance, and extensibility.
3. Understand and implement derivatives pricing models within the OO paradigm, utilizing design patterns.
4. Gain proficiency in basic C++ and OO programming, essential for developing robust financial models.
