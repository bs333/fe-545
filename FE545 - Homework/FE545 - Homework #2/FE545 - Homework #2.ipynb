    "An **Asian option** is a type of *exotic option*. Unlike a vanilla European option where the price of the option is dependent upon the price of the underlying asset at expiry, an Asian option pay-off is a function of multiple points up to and including the price at expiry. Thus it is “path-dependent” as the price relies on knowing how the underlying behaved at certain points before expiry. Asian options in particular base their price off the mean average price of these sampled points. To simplify the problem, we will consider equally distributed sample points beginning at time and ending at maturity,\n",
